            <p>
                Tokyo, formerly known as Edo, became the political center of Japan in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. Since then, it has evolved from a small fishing village to one of the world's largest cities. Tokyo officially became Japan's capital in 1868 during the Meiji Restoration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the centuries, Tokyo has witnessed significant historical events, including the devastation of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and the firebombing during World War II. Despite these challenges, the city has continuously rebuilt itself, maintaining a blend of traditional culture and modern innovation.
